## [1.9.1] - 2025-07-28
### Changed
- Changed how we read VCC's project information [`#1997`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1997)
  - Along with this, building this project no longer needs dotnet SDK to build.
- Migrated the project to Rust 2024 [`#1956`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1956)
  - This is internal changes should not cause behavior changes
  - This would require Rust 1.85 for building this project
- Removed `cargo-about` from build-time dependency [`#1961`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1961)
  - This is internal changes should not cause behavior changes
  - I listed here since this may need update on package metadata of some package managers
- The method to retrieve the list of Unity from Unity Hub [`#1808`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1808) [`#1971`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1971)
- You now can select multiple folders at once to adding project [`#2018`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/2018)
  - I didn't know official VCC had such a feature. Sorry for lack of feature!
- The requirements for unity project [`#2106`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/2106)
  - Since this version, `Projectsettings/ProjectVersion.txt` is required.

### Fixed
- Uninstall package is not reverted successfully if removing package is prevented by `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` [`#2209`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/2209)
- Fixed `a - b` version range is not correctly serialized on the `vpm-manifest.json`

## [1.9.0] - 2025-01-01
### Added
- Per-package `headers` field support [`#718`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/718)
  - Since this is adding support for missing features, I treat this as a bugfix and not bump minor version.
- De-duplicating duplicated projects or Unity in VCC project list [`#1081`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1081)
- `vrc-get cache clear`, command to clear package cache [`#1204`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1204)
- Importing / Exporting Repositories list [`#1209`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1209)

- Skipping finding legacy assets when downgrading / upgrading / reinstalling package [`#1581`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1581)
  - This will speed up the process of downgrading / upgrading / reinstalling package.

### Changed
- Error message will be shown if the SHA256 hash of the downloaded zip file does not match with the hash in the repository [`#1183`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1183)
  - Currently, official VCC does not verify the hash of the downloaded zip file, but it's better to verify the hash.
  - For compatibility, even if the hash does not match, the file will be extracted with an error message.
  - In the future, we may make this a hard error.
- Migration feature is no longer marked as experimental [`#1559`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1559)

### Fixed
- Unity from Unity Hub will be registered as manually registered Unity [`#1081`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1081)
- Fails to uninstall packages on macOS with filesystem that doesn't support resource fork [`#1402`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1402)
  - This is typically seen on ExFAT or FAT32 filesystems, not on APFS or HFS+ filesystems.
  - macOS internally creates files starting with `._` for resource fork if the filesystem does not support resource fork.
  - vrc-get-vpm does not handle this file correctly and fails to uninstall the package.
- Prerelease version is choosen even if good stable version exists [`#1745`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/1745)

## [1.8.2] - 2024-10-16
### Fixed
- Hotfix: Added contact information about author of the project to the User-Agent

## [1.8.1] - 2024-05-13
### Changed
- Relax validation for `package.json` for local user packages [`#750`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/750)
- Improved handling for unlocked packages [`#790`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/790)
- Legacy Assets are remove even if the specified GUID does not match with the actual GUID [`#901`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/901)
  - This follows VCC 2.3.0 beta 3 behavior.
- Updated the recommended Unity 2022 version to 2022.3.22f1 [`#928`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/928)
- Support repositories with bad packages [`#954`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/954)
- Use url in settings.json to load remote repository [`#955`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/955)

### Fixed
- Installing package while Unity can be failed [`#696`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/696)

## [1.8.0] - 2024-03-31
### Added
- Command to migrate a legacy VRCSDK3 project to VPM VRCSDK [`#580`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/580)
  - You can do with `vrc-get migrate vpm` command.

### Changed
- vrc-get now finds unity hub from registry key [`#590`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/590)
- vrc-get specific configuration is moved to `vrc-get/settings.json` [`#607`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/607)
  - This is done because we separated file for vrc-get-gui config file, and we may have more in the future os
    to not dirty the folder, I moved the config file to `vrc-get` folder.
- Legacy Assets are not removed if the specified GUID does not match with the actual GUID [`#677`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/677)
  - This follows VCC 2.3.0 beta behavior.

### Fixed
- Some embedded / installed vpm package is not recognized by vrc-get [`#609`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/609)
  - This makes `d4rkAvatarOptimizer` is recognized as not installed.
- Fails to load all repositories if fails to load one repository [`#551`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/551)
- Legacy Projects cannot be added to VCC project list [`#586`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/586)
- Bad behaviors with unity 2018 [`#605`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/605)
- Prerelease packages are installed if the version range contains prerelease [`#676`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/676)
  - To fix this problem, automatic allow prerelease rule is a bit changed.
  - For resolving dependencies in `vpm-manifest.json`, prerelease is used if version range contains prerelease.
  - For resolving dependencies of packages, prerelease is used if the dependant package is prerelease and the matching version is only contained in prereleases.
  - This does not change behavior of `--prerelease` option.
- False positive conflicts with legacy packages [`#676`](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/pull/676)

## [1.7.1] - 2024-03-01
### Changed
- When you call `vrc-get vcc` without enabling `experimental-vcc` feature, it will show you a warning [`#485`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/485)

### Fixed
- Empty `depeneencies` block of `locked` section in `vpm-manifest.json` is removed [`#478`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/478)
  - This follows the changed behavior of the official VPM command.

## [1.7.0] - 2024-02-27
### Added
- `vrc-get downgrade` which is for downgrading package [`#409`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/409)

### Changed
- `vrc-get` will not search `Packages` folder for legacy assets with GUID [`#439`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/439)
  - Specifying `Packages/<package id>` folder as a legacy folder is still supported.

### Fixed
- projects migrated from `settings.json` to litedb does not have `UnityVersion` [`#411`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/411)
- `vrc-get repo add` adds a relative path to `settings.json` [`#440`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/440)
- `vrc-get repo add` accepts invalid path to the local repository [`#440`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/440)
- last modified on the vcc project database is not updated [`#443`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/443)

  - This feature is not stable yet. Using this feature will warn you about it and use at your own risk. [`#362`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/362)
- Feature to ignore official / curated repositories [`#352`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/352)
  - You can enable this feature in `vrc-get-settings.json` by setting `ignoreOfficialRepository` or `ignoreCuratedRepository` to true.
  - This feature is replacement of `experimental-override-predefined` feature since 1.4.1.
    - Please add alternative repository to user repository and enable this feature to use alternative repository instead of official / curated repository.
  - This feature is not stable yet. Using this feature will warn you about it and use at your own risk. [`#362`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/362) [`#365`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/365)

- Tests for `vrc-get-vpm` module. [`#393`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/393)
  - For basic project operations, I added tests in `vrc-get-vpm` module.
- `vrc-get i --name <name>` to install package by name [`#398`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/398)
  - Currently, name-based search ignores whitespace in the name.
  - This feature is experimental. Behavior may change in the future.
- `vrc-get` property in `package.json` for extra metadata for vrc-get [`#399`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/399)
  - with `yanked` field, you can yank the package from the repository. [`#399`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/399)
    - setting `"yanked": true` will make your package yanked and `"yanked": "reason"` tell the reason of yanking.
  - with `aliases` field, you can add aliases for `vrc-get i --name` described above [`#399`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/399)

  - I may add verification for downloaded zip file in the future.
- Better logging style [`#407`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/407)
  - Now, `vrc-get` uses our formatting style for logging if none of `RUST_LOG_STYLE` and `RUST_LOG` are set.
  - This style is shorter than `env_logger`'s default style so better for default CLI usage.
  - If you need more detailed logs, you can set `RUST_LOG` to get more detailed information.

### Changed
- Improved confirmation behaviour about updating `dependencies` [`#395`](https://github.com/anatawa12/vrc-get/pull/395)
  - Previously, the confirmation show nothing about updating `dependencies` since it's almost safe (just updating `vpm-manifest.json`).
  - Since this release, `vrc-get` shows about what's updating `dependencies`
  - In addition, if actual operaion is just updating `dependencies`, `vrc-get` will just show updates and apply changes without confirmation.

### Fixed
